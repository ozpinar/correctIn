## Abstract

When people are learning a new language, they generally underestimate the
power of really using that language in their daily life. The books, the language
schools or any other materials do not give enough opportunity of using the
language to the learners. As a result of that even though they theoretically
understand the concepts of that language they can still be weak in producing
something in that language. Also, even if language learners try to use that
language they are still very prone to make mistakes while using the language
they are learning. If they are not corrected by someone, that may lead to
learning phrases, words, and sentences in the wrong way. In this study a
language exchange application is proposed. The application that is available
both in mobile platforms and the web, aims to create a portal for language
learners and native speakers. The learners are able to post anything that is
interesting for them, such as a moment in their life, something that is popular
or anything they want, similar to a social media entry. Those entries will
be visible to the speakers of that language and they will be able to correct or
propose better expressions interacting with the post.
